# rise up and resist...

On April 12th, 2019, the Department of Defense will begin to implement Directive-Type Memorandum 19-004, **a ban on transgender individuals serving openly in the military**. This directive is inhumane, discriminatory, and harms individuals who are willing and able to serve in the U.S. Armed Forces.

## To be clear...

* this is more than a military issue
* this is more than an LGBTQ+ issue
* this is more than a transgender issue
* **this is an issue of human rights**
